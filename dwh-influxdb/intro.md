InfluxDB is a platform for building & operating time series applications, monitoring metrics and much more. In this interactive tutorial we are going to learn the basics of working with InfluxDB. That includes:

- Setting up a docker InfluxDB docker container
- Configuring the InfluxDB instance
- Loading preexisting .csv-data into a bucket
- Continuously adding data to our bucket with Python

To take the most of this course, you should know how to program in Python or another language that would allow you to understand Python syntax.
