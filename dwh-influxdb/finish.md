Thats it, you did it. In this course you have learned how to

- Set up and configure your own InfluxDB instance with docker
- Load preexisting .csv-data into a bucket
- Continuously add data to your bucket with Python

While this is definitely not everything you can do with InfluxDB, I hope that it at least layed the groundwork for your future works to come.
Best of luck!
